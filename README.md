Introduction
============

This module displays a list of numbers as rectangles with their heights proportional to size of the number.
The list can then be sorted from least to greatest using one of many sorting algorithms.
The list is sorted in real-time as shown by the rectangles being sorted from shortest to tallest.
Currently, the sorting algorithms that can be chosen are bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort, and the only option for creating a list is generating a random list of 64 numbers.
